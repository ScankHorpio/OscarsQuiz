# OscarsQuiz

First attempt at using Python by pulling in CSV data for Oscar winners. 
Quiz currently allows users to select an Oscar category before being presented with a randomised date question.
Currently the GUI isn't fully functional, but selecting the category and then closing it triggers the quiz to continue.
